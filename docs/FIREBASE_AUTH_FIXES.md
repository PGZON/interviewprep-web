# Firebase Authentication Changes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Firebase authentication issues.

## Changes Made

1. **API URL Configuration Fixed**
   - Maintained API base URL in configuration files as `http://localhost:8080/api`
   - Removed any `/api` prefix from endpoints in `authService.js`
   - This prevents double prefixing of `/api` in requests

2. **Firebase Authentication Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling for common Google authentication issues
   - Added detailed error messages for popup blocked and CORS-related errors
   - Added custom parameters to the Google provider to improve CORS handling

3. **Added Firebase UID to Backend Requests**
   - Added the Firebase UID to the authentication requests
   - This addresses the "Firebase UID is required" error from the backend
   - Enhanced logging to help diagnose authentication issues

3. **Debugging Enhancements**
   - Added more console logs to track the authentication flow
   - Added specific error messages for different authentication failure scenarios
   - Included debugging for API endpoint URLs to verify correct paths

## Files Modified

- `src/config/config.js`: Maintained API base URL with `/api` prefix
- `src/services/authService.js`: Removed `/api` prefix from endpoints, enhanced error handling
- `src/config/firebase.js`: Improved Google auth provider configuration
- `src/components/Auth/LoginForm.js`: Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- `.env` and `.env.development`: Maintained API URL configuration with `/api` prefix

## Testing the Changes

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Restart the application
3. Try logging in with email/password first to verify basic authentication
4. Then test Google authentication
5. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Common Issues and Solutions

### CORS Issues with Firebase Popups
If you're still experiencing CORS issues:
- Ensure the backend has proper CORS configuration
- Try using a different browser
- Disable Enhanced Protection in Chrome if enabled

### 400 Bad Request Errors
If you're still getting 400 errors:
- Verify the backend API is running and accessible
- Check the backend logs for specific error details
- Ensure the Firebase configuration in the backend matches your Firebase project
