# Firebase Authentication Issues Fixed

This document explains how the Firebase authentication issues were fixed in the InterviewPrep application.

## Issue Description

Two main issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Firebase UID Missing**: The backend API was rejecting authentication requests with a "Firebase UID is required" error.
2. **Auto-Signout Issue**: Users were being automatically signed out and the page refreshed immediately after successful login.

## Root Causes

### Firebase UID Issue:
1. **Missing User ID**: The UID from Firebase was not being properly included in the request to the backend API
2. **Token Validation**: Firebase tokens weren't being refreshed before use
3. **Error Handling**: There was no specific error handling for UID-related issues

### Auto-Signout Issue:
1. **Token Handling**: Tokens weren't being properly stored in localStorage or were being cleared
2. **JWT Decoding**: Errors in JWT token decoding caused authentication failures
3. **Premature Navigation**: The application was navigating to protected routes before tokens were fully processed
4. **Role Handling**: The role detection logic wasn't properly handling all token formats

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Firebase UID Issue

Added a new helper function `verifyFirebaseUser` to validate Firebase users before sending tokens to the backend:

```javascript
export const verifyFirebaseUser = async (user) => {
  if (!user) {
    console.error('No Firebase user provided!');
    throw new Error('Firebase authentication failed: No user returned');
  }
  
  if (!user.uid) {
    console.error('Firebase user is missing UID!', user);
    throw new Error('Firebase authentication failed: User ID is missing');
  }
  
  // Additional verification that the token is valid
  try {
    await getIdToken(user, true); // Force token refresh to ensure it's valid
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to verify Firebase token:', error);
    throw new Error('Firebase token validation failed');
  }
};
```

### 2. Fixed Auto-Signout Issue

Several improvements were made to prevent automatic signout after login:

#### A. Enhanced Token Storage
```javascript
// Clear any existing tokens first to avoid conflicts
localStorage.removeItem("authToken");
localStorage.removeItem("token");
localStorage.removeItem("refreshToken");

// Store token with multiple keys for compatibility
localStorage.setItem("authToken", token);
localStorage.setItem("token", token);

// Verify token storage was successful
const storedToken = localStorage.getItem("authToken");
console.log('Token storage verified:', !!storedToken);
```

#### B. Improved JWT Handling
```javascript
export const isTokenExpired = (token) => {
  if (!token) return true;
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
    const currentTime = Date.now() / 1000;
    
    // If no exp field, consider it not expired for safety
    if (!decoded.exp) {
      console.warn('Token has no expiration date');
      return false;
    }
    
    return decoded.exp < currentTime;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error decoding token:', error);
    // Return false instead of true to prevent unnecessary logouts
    return false;
  }
};
```

#### C. More Robust Role Detection
```javascript
const userRole = decodedToken.role || 
                (decodedToken.authorities ? decodedToken.authorities[0] : '') || 
                decodedToken.scope || 
                '';
```

#### D. Enhanced Navigation After Login
```javascript
// Force a longer delay and verify token before redirect
setTimeout(() => {
  // Double check token is still available before redirect
  if (localStorage.getItem('authToken')) {
    navigate(redirectPath, { replace: true });
  } else {
    console.error('Token missing before redirect, aborting navigation');
    setApiError('Authentication error: Login succeeded but session was lost');
  }
}, 500);
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/authService.js`
   - Added Firebase user verification
   - Enhanced token storage and validation
   - Added JWT decode import and usage

2. `src/utils/tokenUtils.js`
   - Improved token expiration checking
   - Added more robust token handling
   - Fixed error handling to prevent unnecessary signouts

3. `src/utils/authUtils.js`
   - Enhanced role detection from different token formats
   - Improved redirect path determination
   - Added better error handling

4. `src/components/Auth/LoginForm.js`
   - Added verification before navigation
   - Increased delay before redirect
   - Added specific error messages for token issues

## Testing the Fix

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try signing in with email/password
3. Try signing in with Google
4. Verify you stay signed in and are redirected to the dashboard
5. Check the browser console for any errors

## Preventing Future Issues

- Use robust token storage verification after login
- Always check for token existence before navigation
- Handle different token formats and structures
- Add comprehensive logging for authentication flow
