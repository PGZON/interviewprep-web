# InterviewPrep

InterviewPrep is an AI-powered web application designed to help users prepare for technical interviews. It offers personalized coding questions, instant feedback, progress tracking, and a modern, engaging UI.

## Project Overview
InterviewPrep combines a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend, leveraging AI to generate and review coding questions. The platform is built for software engineers, students, and job seekers aiming to ace their next technical interview.

## Features
- AI-generated coding and MCQ questions
- Real-time feedback and answer review
- User dashboard with progress tracking
- Session summaries and analytics
- Admin panel for managing questions and users
- Responsive, modern UI with gradient branding
- Secure authentication and JWT-based sessions

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java, JWT, REST APIs
- **AI Integration:** HuggingFace API
- **Database:** (your DB here, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Other:** React Icons, ESLint, Create React App

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pgzon/interviewprep.git
   cd interviewprep
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
